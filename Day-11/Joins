                 from table_name1 join name table_name2.
                on <filter condition>
example:
select *
from emp cross join dept;

oracle:
select columnname
from tablename1,tablename2;

                                                      2)Inner join/equi join

join condition:
         ->it's a condition on which the two tables are merged.
       SYNTAX:
             tablename1.columnname = table name2.columnname.
Ansi:
  select column_name
  from table_name1 Inner join table_name2
  on <join_condition>;

oracle:
     select column_name
     from table_name1 , table_name2
     on <join_condition>;

ex:
select*
from emp inner join dept
On emp . deptno = dept . deptno;

1) Name of the employee and location?
      select ename,loc
      from emp,dept
      where emp.deptno=dept.deptno;
2)dname and salary for all the employee working in accounting?

select*
from emp right outer join dept
On emp.deptno=dept.deptno;

   ->full outer join 
eg:
select*
